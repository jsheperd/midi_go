# midi_go
some scripts about playing on my roland and drumpad

I have got a HP201 Roland piano with really nice midi sound and an Akai LPD8 midi drumpad.
I am just playing with the async go on linux.
I know there are programs to play on these, but I like to hack it :)

#rawmidi
This is the simplest method, read a midi channel, make som efiltering and write something else to another midi channel.
